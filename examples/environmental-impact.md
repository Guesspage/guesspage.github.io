# Environmental Impact Assessment of a New Industrial Facility

This example demonstrates how to use probabilistic modeling for an environmental impact assessment of a new industrial facility.

## Facility Overview

Let's consider a new manufacturing facility with the following key environmental factors:
1. Air Emissions
2. Water Usage and Discharge
3. Solid Waste Generation
4. Energy Consumption
5. Land Use Impact
6. Biodiversity Impact

## Air Emissions

Let's model the air emissions:

Annual CO2 emissions: [co2_emissions = normal(60000, 5000)] metric tons
Annual PM2.5 emissions: [particulate_matter = normal(12.5, 2.5)] metric tons
Annual Volatile Organic Compound emissions: [voc_emissions = normal(6.5, 1.5)] metric tons

Total air impact: [total_air_impact = (co2_emissions / 1000) + (particulate_matter * 10) + (voc_emissions * 5)]

## Water Usage and Discharge

Now, let's consider water-related impacts:

Annual water consumption: [water_consumption = normal(600000, 50000)] cubic meters
Wastewater generated: [wastewater_generated = water_consumption * normal(0.75, 0.05)] cubic meters (70-80% of water consumed becomes wastewater)
Water treatment efficiency: [water_treatment_efficiency = uniform(0.9, 0.95)] (90-95% treatment efficiency)

Untreated wastewater: [untreated_wastewater = wastewater_generated * (1 - water_treatment_efficiency)] cubic meters

## Solid Waste Generation

Let's model solid waste generation:

Annual solid waste: [total_solid_waste = normal(12500, 1250)] metric tons
Recycling rate: [recycling_rate = uniform(0.4, 0.6)] (40-60% recycling rate)

Landfill waste: [landfill_waste = total_solid_waste * (1 - recycling_rate)] metric tons

## Energy Consumption

Let's consider energy consumption:

Annual electricity consumption: [electricity_consumption = normal(12500000, 1250000)] kWh
Renewable energy ratio: [renewable_energy_ratio = uniform(0.2, 0.3)] (20-30% energy from renewable sources)

Non-renewable energy consumption: [non_renewable_energy = electricity_consumption * (1 - renewable_energy_ratio)] kWh

## Land Use Impact

Let's model the land use impact:

Facility area: [facility_area = normal(125000, 12500)] square meters
Greenspace ratio: [greenspace_ratio = uniform(0.1, 0.2)] (10-20% of area dedicated to green space)

Developed land: [developed_land = facility_area * (1 - greenspace_ratio)] square meters

## Biodiversity Impact

Let's estimate the biodiversity impact:

Species richness before development: [species_richness_before = normal(125, 25)]
Habitat loss factor: [habitat_loss_factor = uniform(0.2, 0.3)] (20-30% habitat loss due to facility)

Species loss: [species_loss = species_richness_before * habitat_loss_factor]

## Environmental Impact Score

Let's create an overall environmental impact score (0-100, where higher is worse):

Air score: [air_score = min(100, (total_air_impact / 1000) * 20)]
Water score: [water_score = min(100, (untreated_wastewater / 100000) * 25)]
Waste score: [waste_score = min(100, (landfill_waste / 10000) * 15)]
Energy score: [energy_score = min(100, (non_renewable_energy / 10000000) * 20)]
Land score: [land_score = min(100, (developed_land / 100000) * 10)]
Biodiversity score: [biodiversity_score = min(100, (species_loss / 50) * 10)]

Overall environmental score: [overall_environmental_score = (air_score + water_score + waste_score + energy_score + land_score + biodiversity_score) / 6]

## Mitigation Measures

Let's model the effectiveness of potential mitigation measures:

Air filtration efficiency: [air_filtration_efficiency = uniform(0.7, 0.9)]
Water recycling rate: [water_recycling_rate = uniform(0.3, 0.5)]
Waste reduction rate: [waste_reduction_rate = uniform(0.2, 0.4)]
Energy efficiency improvement: [energy_efficiency_improvement = uniform(0.1, 0.2)]
Habitat restoration rate: [habitat_restoration_rate = uniform(0.3, 0.5)]

## Mitigated Impacts

Now, let's calculate the mitigated environmental impacts:

Mitigated air impact: [mitigated_air_impact = total_air_impact * (1 - air_filtration_efficiency)]
Mitigated water impact: [mitigated_water_impact = untreated_wastewater * (1 - water_recycling_rate)]
Mitigated waste impact: [mitigated_waste_impact = landfill_waste * (1 - waste_reduction_rate)]
Mitigated energy impact: [mitigated_energy_impact = non_renewable_energy * (1 - energy_efficiency_improvement)]
Mitigated biodiversity impact: [mitigated_biodiversity_impact = species_loss * (1 - habitat_restoration_rate)]

## Mitigated Environmental Score

Mitigated air score: [mitigated_air_score = min(100, (mitigated_air_impact / 1000) * 20)]
Mitigated water score: [mitigated_water_score = min(100, (mitigated_water_impact / 100000) * 25)]
Mitigated waste score: [mitigated_waste_score = min(100, (mitigated_waste_impact / 10000) * 15)]
Mitigated energy score: [mitigated_energy_score = min(100, (mitigated_energy_impact / 10000000) * 20)]
Mitigated biodiversity score: [mitigated_biodiversity_score = min(100, (mitigated_biodiversity_impact / 50) * 10)]

Mitigated overall score: [mitigated_overall_score = (mitigated_air_score + mitigated_water_score + mitigated_waste_score + mitigated_energy_score + land_score + mitigated_biodiversity_score) / 6]

## Compliance Probability

Let's estimate the probability of meeting environmental regulations:

Air compliance: [air_compliance = if(mitigated_air_score < 30, 1, 0)]
Water compliance: [water_compliance = if(mitigated_water_score < 35, 1, 0)]
Waste compliance: [waste_compliance = if(mitigated_waste_score < 25, 1, 0)]
Energy compliance: [energy_compliance = if(mitigated_energy_score < 40, 1, 0)]
Biodiversity compliance: [biodiversity_compliance = if(mitigated_biodiversity_score < 20, 1, 0)]

Overall compliance probability: [overall_compliance_probability = (air_compliance + water_compliance + waste_compliance + energy_compliance + biodiversity_compliance) / 5]

## Economic Impact of Environmental Measures

Let's estimate the economic impact of environmental measures:

Mitigation cost: [mitigation_cost = normal(6500000, 750000)] (Cost of implementing mitigation measures)
Potential fines avoided: [potential_fines_avoided = normal(2000000, 500000)] (Potential environmental fines avoided)
Operational savings: [operational_savings = normal(750000, 125000)] (Annual operational savings from efficiency improvements)

Net economic impact: [net_economic_impact = potential_fines_avoided + operational_savings - mitigation_cost]

This model helps environmental scientists and project managers assess the potential environmental impacts of a new industrial facility, evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures, and estimate compliance probabilities. It can be customized with specific data and additional factors relevant to the particular facility and location for more accurate assessment.
