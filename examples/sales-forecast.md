# Sales Forecast Model

This example demonstrates how to create a probabilistic sales forecast model.

## Base Sales

Let's start with a base monthly sales figure: [base_sales = normal(100000, 10000)] (Average of $100,000 with $10,000 standard deviation)

## Seasonal Factors

We'll consider seasonal factors that affect sales:

Summer boost: [summer_boost = uniform(1.2, 1.4)] (20-40% boost in summer)
Winter decline: [winter_decline = uniform(0.8, 0.9)] (10-20% decline in winter)
Spring/Fall neutral: [spring_fall_neutral = normal(1, 0.05)] (Slight variation in spring/fall)

## Market Trends

Let's factor in overall market trends: [market_growth = normal(1.03, 0.01)] (3% annual market growth with 1% standard deviation)

## Product-Specific Factors

Now, let's consider factors specific to our product:

Product popularity: [product_popularity = normal(1, 0.1)] (Product becoming more/less popular)
Price elasticity: [price_elasticity = normal(1, 0.05)] (Effect of price changes on demand)

## Competitor Actions

We'll also factor in potential actions from competitors: [competitor_impact = normal(1, 0.1)] (Competitor actions might increase or decrease our sales)

## Marketing Effectiveness

Let's consider the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns: [marketing_multiplier = normal(1.1, 0.05)] (10% boost from marketing efforts with 5% standard deviation)

## Final Sales Forecast

Now, let's combine all these factors to create our final sales forecast: [forecast = base_sales * summer_boost * market_growth * product_popularity * price_elasticity * competitor_impact * marketing_multiplier]

## Sales Targets

Let's say our sales target for the month is $150,000. What's the probability of meeting this target? [meets_target = if(forecast >= 150000, 1, 0)]

## Profit Margin

Let's also consider our profit margin: [profit_margin = normal(0.2, 0.05)] (20% average profit margin with 5% standard deviation)

## Projected Profit

Now we can calculate our projected profit: [projected_profit = forecast * profit_margin]

This model helps sales managers understand the various factors affecting their sales forecast, the likelihood of meeting targets, and potential profitability. It can be adjusted based on specific industry factors and company data for more accurate predictions.
