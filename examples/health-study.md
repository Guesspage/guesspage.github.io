# Health Study: Impact of Diet and Exercise on Weight Loss

This example demonstrates how to use probabilistic modeling to analyze the results of a health study on weight loss.

## Study Overview

Let's consider a 12-week study examining the impact of diet and exercise on weight loss. We'll look at three groups:
1. Diet Only
2. Exercise Only
3. Diet and Exercise Combined

## Participant Data

Let's model the initial weights of participants: [initial_weight = normal(200, 20)] pounds.

## Diet Impact

Let's model the impact of the diet:

Daily calorie reduction: [calorie_reduction = normal(400, 100)]
Diet adherence: [diet_adherence = uniform(0.7, 0.9)] (70-90% adherence to the diet)

Weekly weight loss due to diet: [diet_impact = (calorie_reduction * diet_adherence * 7) / 3500] pounds (3500 calories = 1 pound)

## Exercise Impact

Now, let's model the impact of exercise:

Calories burned per session: [calories_burned_per_session = normal(300, 50)]
Number of exercise sessions per week: [sessions_per_week = normal(4, 1)]
Exercise adherence: [exercise_adherence = uniform(0.6, 0.8)] (60-80% adherence to the exercise plan)

Weekly weight loss due to exercise: [exercise_impact = (calories_burned_per_session * sessions_per_week * exercise_adherence) / 3500] pounds

## Metabolic Factors

Let's consider individual metabolic factors: [metabolic_factor = normal(1, 0.1)] (Individual metabolic variation)

## Weight Loss Calculations

Now, let's calculate the weight loss for each group over the 12-week study:

Diet Only Group: [diet_only_loss = diet_impact * 12 * metabolic_factor] pounds
Exercise Only Group: [exercise_only_loss = exercise_impact * 12 * metabolic_factor] pounds
Diet and Exercise Group: [diet_exercise_loss = (diet_impact + exercise_impact) * 12 * metabolic_factor] pounds

## Final Weights

Let's calculate the final weights for each group:

Diet Only Group: [diet_only_final = initial_weight - diet_only_loss] pounds
Exercise Only Group: [exercise_only_final = initial_weight - exercise_only_loss] pounds
Diet and Exercise Group: [diet_exercise_final = initial_weight - diet_exercise_loss] pounds

## Goal Achievement

Let's set a weight loss goal of 15 pounds and see how each group performs:

Diet Only Group: [diet_only_goal = if(diet_only_loss >= 15, 1, 0)]
Exercise Only Group: [exercise_only_goal = if(exercise_only_loss >= 15, 1, 0)]
Diet and Exercise Group: [diet_exercise_goal = if(diet_exercise_loss >= 15, 1, 0)]

## Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculations

Let's calculate the BMI changes. We'll assume an average height of 5'9" (69 inches):

Height: [height_inches = 69] inches
Height squared: [height_squared = height_inches * height_inches]

Initial BMI: [initial_bmi = (initial_weight / height_squared) * 703]
Diet Only Final BMI: [diet_only_final_bmi = (diet_only_final / height_squared) * 703]
Exercise Only Final BMI: [exercise_only_final_bmi = (exercise_only_final / height_squared) * 703]
Diet and Exercise Final BMI: [diet_exercise_final_bmi = (diet_exercise_final / height_squared) * 703]

## Health Risk Reduction

Let's model the reduction in health risks based on weight loss:

Risk reduction factor: [risk_reduction_factor = normal(0.025, 0.005)] (2-3% risk reduction per pound lost)

Diet Only risk reduction: [diet_only_risk_reduction = diet_only_loss * risk_reduction_factor]
Exercise Only risk reduction: [exercise_only_risk_reduction = exercise_only_loss * risk_reduction_factor]
Diet and Exercise risk reduction: [diet_exercise_risk_reduction = diet_exercise_loss * risk_reduction_factor]

## Participant Satisfaction

Let's model participant satisfaction based on their results:

Diet Only satisfaction: [diet_only_satisfaction = normal(0.7, 0.1) * (diet_only_loss / 15)] (Scaled by achievement of 15-pound goal)
Exercise Only satisfaction: [exercise_only_satisfaction = normal(0.8, 0.1) * (exercise_only_loss / 15)]
Diet and Exercise satisfaction: [diet_exercise_satisfaction = normal(0.9, 0.1) * (diet_exercise_loss / 15)]

## Long-term Success Probability

Let's estimate the probability of maintaining weight loss after 1 year:

Diet Only maintenance: [diet_only_maintenance = uniform(0.5, 0.7)]
Exercise Only maintenance: [exercise_only_maintenance = uniform(0.6, 0.8)]
Diet and Exercise maintenance: [diet_exercise_maintenance = uniform(0.7, 0.9)]

## Study Conclusions

1. Average weight loss for each group:
   - Diet Only: [diet_only_loss] pounds
   - Exercise Only: [exercise_only_loss] pounds
   - Diet and Exercise: [diet_exercise_loss] pounds

2. Probability of achieving 15-pound weight loss goal:
   - Diet Only: [diet_only_goal]
   - Exercise Only: [exercise_only_goal]
   - Diet and Exercise: [diet_exercise_goal]

3. Average BMI reduction:
   - Diet Only: [initial_bmi - diet_only_final_bmi]
   - Exercise Only: [initial_bmi - exercise_only_final_bmi]
   - Diet and Exercise: [initial_bmi - diet_exercise_final_bmi]

4. Average health risk reduction:
   - Diet Only: [diet_only_risk_reduction]%
   - Exercise Only: [exercise_only_risk_reduction]%
   - Diet and Exercise: [diet_exercise_risk_reduction]%

5. Average participant satisfaction:
   - Diet Only: [diet_only_satisfaction]
   - Exercise Only: [exercise_only_satisfaction]
   - Diet and Exercise: [diet_exercise_satisfaction]

6. Probability of maintaining weight loss after 1 year:
   - Diet Only: [diet_only_maintenance]
   - Exercise Only: [exercise_only_maintenance]
   - Diet and Exercise: [diet_exercise_maintenance]

This model helps health researchers understand the potential outcomes of different weight loss strategies, considering various factors and uncertainties. It can be refined with more specific data from the study and additional health markers for a more comprehensive analysis.
