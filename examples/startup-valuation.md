# Startup Valuation Model

This example demonstrates how to use probabilistic modeling for startup valuation.

## Startup Overview

Let's consider a tech startup with the following key factors:
1. Revenue Growth
2. Customer Acquisition
3. Churn Rate
4. Operating Expenses
5. Market Size
6. Competitive Landscape

## Revenue Model

Let's start with the current annual revenue and project growth:

Current annual revenue: [current_revenue = 1000000] ($1 million)
Year 1 growth rate: [growth_rate_year1 = normal(1, 0.2)] (100% growth on average)
Year 2 growth rate: [growth_rate_year2 = normal(0.8, 0.2)] (80% growth on average)
Year 3 growth rate: [growth_rate_year3 = normal(0.6, 0.2)] (60% growth on average)

Projected revenue:
Year 1: [revenue_year1 = current_revenue * (1 + growth_rate_year1)]
Year 2: [revenue_year2 = revenue_year1 * (1 + growth_rate_year2)]
Year 3: [revenue_year3 = revenue_year2 * (1 + growth_rate_year3)]

## Customer Acquisition

Let's model customer acquisition:

Current customers: [current_customers = 10000]
Monthly customer acquisition rate: [customer_acquisition_rate = normal(0.065, 0.015)] (6.5% monthly growth on average)
Cost per acquired customer: [acquisition_cost = normal(125, 25)]

Projected customers:
Year 1: [customers_year1 = current_customers * (1 + customer_acquisition_rate) ^ 12]
Year 2: [customers_year2 = customers_year1 * ( 1 + customer_acquisition_rate) ^ 12]
Year 3: [customers_year3 = customers_year2 * (1 + customer_acquisition_rate) ^ 12]

## Churn Rate

Now, let's consider customer churn:

Monthly churn rate: [monthly_churn_rate = normal(0.03, 0.01)] (3% monthly churn on average)

Retained customers:
Year 1: [retained_customers_year1 = customers_year1 * (1 - monthly_churn_rate) ^ 12]
Year 2: [retained_customers_year2 = customers_year2 * (1 - monthly_churn_rate) ^ 12]
Year 3: [retained_customers_year3 = customers_year3 * (1 - monthly_churn_rate) ^ 12]

## Operating Expenses

Let's model the operating expenses:

Operating expenses ratio: [opex_ratio = normal(0.7, 0.1)] (Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue)

Projected operating expenses:
Year 1: [opex_year1 = revenue_year1 * opex_ratio]
Year 2: [opex_year2 = revenue_year2 * opex_ratio]
Year 3: [opex_year3 = revenue_year3 * opex_ratio]

## Market Size and Penetration

Let's estimate the total addressable market (TAM) and market penetration:

Total addressable market: [total_addressable_market = normal(1250000000, 250000000)] ($1.25 billion TAM on average)
Annual market growth rate: [market_growth_rate = normal(0.065, 0.015)] (6.5% annual market growth on average)

Market size in Year 3: [market_size_year3 = total_addressable_market * (1 + market_growth_rate) ^ 3]
Market penetration in Year 3: [market_penetration_year3 = retained_customers_year3 / (market_size_year3 / 100)]% (Assuming $100 average revenue per user)

## Competitive Landscape

Let's factor in the competitive landscape:

Competitor strength: [competitor_strength = normal(0.7, 0.1)] (0.7 on average, where higher means stronger competition)
Our competitive advantage: [our_competitive_advantage = normal(1.1, 0.1)] (1.1 on average, where higher means stronger advantage)

Competitive factor: [competitive_factor = our_competitive_advantage / competitor_strength]

## Profitability

Now, let's calculate profitability:

Profit:
Year 1: [profit_year1 = revenue_year1 - opex_year1]
Year 2: [profit_year2 = revenue_year2 - opex_year2]
Year 3: [profit_year3 = revenue_year3 - opex_year3]

## Valuation Multiples

Let's consider some common valuation multiples:

Revenue multiple: [revenue_multiple = normal(6.5, 1.5)] (6.5x revenue multiple on average)
EBITDA multiple: [ebitda_multiple = normal(20, 5)] (20x EBITDA multiple on average)

## Valuation Calculations

Now, let's calculate different valuation estimates:

Revenue-based valuation: [revenue_based_valuation = revenue_year3 * revenue_multiple]
EBITDA-based valuation: [ebitda_based_valuation = profit_year3 * ebitda_multiple]

Customer lifetime value: [customer_lifetime_value = (revenue_year3 / retained_customers_year3) / monthly_churn_rate]
Customer-based valuation: [customer_based_valuation = retained_customers_year3 * customer_lifetime_value * competitive_factor]

## Final Valuation Estimate

Let's combine these valuation methods for a final estimate:

Final valuation: [final_valuation = (revenue_based_valuation + ebitda_based_valuation + customer_based_valuation) / 3]

## Risk Factors

Let's consider some risk factors:

Execution risk: [execution_risk = normal(0.85, 0.15)] (0.85 on average, where lower means higher risk)
Market risk: [market_risk = normal(0.95, 0.15)] (0.95 on average, where lower means higher risk)
Financial risk: [financial_risk = normal(1.05, 0.15)] (1.05 on average, where lower means higher risk)

Overall risk factor: [overall_risk_factor = (execution_risk + market_risk + financial_risk) / 3]

## Risk-Adjusted Valuation

Risk-adjusted valuation: [risk_adjusted_valuation = final_valuation * overall_risk_factor]

## Funding Needs

Let's estimate the funding needs:

Runway needed: [runway_months = normal(21, 3)] months (21 months of runway needed on average)
Monthly burn rate: [monthly_burn_rate = opex_year1 / 12]

Funding needed: [funding_needed = monthly_burn_rate * runway_months]

## Investment Scenarios

Let's model different investment scenarios:

Seed round: [seed_round = normal(2500000, 500000)] ($2.5 million seed round on average)
Series A: [series_a = normal(6500000, 1500000)] ($6.5 million Series A on average)

Equity given up:
Seed round: [seed_equity = seed_round / risk_adjusted_valuation]%
Series A: [series_a_equity = series_a / risk_adjusted_valuation]%

## Exit Scenarios

Let's model potential exit scenarios:

Exit multiple: [exit_multiple = normal(4, 1)] (4x return on current valuation on average)
Exit probability: [exit_probability = normal(0.3, 0.1)] (30% probability of successful exit on average)

Potential exit value: [potential_exit_value = risk_adjusted_valuation * exit_multiple]
Expected exit value: [expected_exit_value = potential_exit_value * exit_probability]

## Key Metrics

1. Revenue CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate): [revenue_cagr = (revenue_year3 / current_revenue) ^ (1/3) - 1]

2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Payback Period: [cac_payback = acquisition_cost / (revenue_year3 / retained_customers_year3)] months

3. Rule of 40 (Growth Rate + Profit Margin): [rule_of_40 = revenue_cagr + (profit_year3 / revenue_year3)]

4. Burn Multiple (Capital Burned / ARR Added): [burn_multiple = funding_needed / (revenue_year3 - current_revenue)]

This model helps startup founders, investors, and analysts estimate the potential value of a startup, considering various factors and uncertainties. It can be customized with more specific data and additional factors relevant to the particular startup and industry for more accurate valuation.
